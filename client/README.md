## Error handling

- Subscribe to the error and unhandled rejected promise events.
- Create an abstraction that would allow you to attach more information to the errors. Examples: React stack.
- Render outside of react.
- Keep the state in a separate storage location.

- Put a react error boundary inside and outside the router.
- Abstract that away.
